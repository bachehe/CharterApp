# CharterApp

Charter is app being a part of engineering diploma, simplifying x-ray research.
App allows user to create 4 types of charts, based on its geometry:

```
BB
SKP
STRESS
```

Following geometries requires individual input, such as

```
lamp element
linear factor
angle
hkl
```

Application will allow up to 4 charts at once:

For more accurate values, user can check such details by feature:

<b> Second part of Charter is desired for calculating earlier mentioned values, which are: </b>

<b> Absorption </b>

<b> Linear Factor </b>

>Density of linear factor has to be given from provided database

Now you can relax if your x-ray project meets deadline :zzz:
